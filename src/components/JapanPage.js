                A Statement of Purpose is a personal essay where you articulate
                your academic and career goals, why you're interested in
                studying at a particular institution, and how you envision your
                studies contributing to your future plans. This document helps
                admissions committees understand your motivations and
                aspirations.

                International students often need to demonstrate that they have
                sufficient funds to cover tuition fees, living expenses, and
                other costs associated with studying in the Japan. This can be
                done through bank statements, scholarship letters, or
                sponsorship letters.
