                Demonstrating proficiency in English is crucial as it's the
                primary language of instruction. This requirement is often met
                through standardized tests like TOEFL or IELTS, or sometimes
                through the university's own English proficiency exams.

                Some courses or universities may require you to take additional admissions tests, particularly for highly competitive programs. These tests could be subject-specific tests or general aptitude tests like the UKCAT, BMAT, or LNAT.

                A Statement of Purpose is a personal essay where you articulate
                your academic and career goals, why you're interested in
                studying at a particular institution, and how you envision your
                studies contributing to your future plans. This document helps
                admissions committees understand your motivations and
                aspirations.

                International students often need to demonstrate that they have
                sufficient funds to cover tuition fees, living expenses, and
                other costs associated with studying in the USA. This can be
                done through bank statements, scholarship letters, or
                sponsorship letters.
